A group project to evaluate whether Magist is a partner for Eniac's expansion in Brazil

Summary

Founded ten years ago in Spain, Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. Eniac is exploring an expansion to the Brazilian market. Magist is a Brazilian SaaS company that offers a centralized order, stock and warehouse management, product shipment, and customer service related to the shipment. In Brazil, Eniac is considering signing a 3-year contract with Magist as an intermediate step, while it tests the market, creates brand awareness, and explores the option of setting up its own supply chain management. The challenges are:
1.	It is not clear that Magist is a good partner for these high-end tech products.
2.	Among Eniac’s efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key.
3.	The delivery fees resulting from Magist’s deal with the public Post Office might be cheap, but at what cost? 
4.	Are deliveries fast enough?
Our task was to answer the business questions, meet the board of directors and present our recommendations. 
The key questions were:
•	Is Magist a good fit for high-end tech products?
•	Are orders delivered on time?

Languages and Libraries Used

We used Tableau for visualisation, MySQL to explore the table and google slide for our presentation.

Key Learnings

The need to understand Eniac's requirements and Magist's capabilities was very important in tackling the business issues and proved helpful in exploring the table - what exactly to look for. To extract useful information from for use in Tableau, creating new tables from the database was of utmost importance. The project gave me more insight into scenario analysis, data exploration and visualisation.

Challenges Overcame

As a team, we had different views on the requirements of the tasks at the beginning. However, we were able to set clear objectives and work towards breaking the project down into different tasks.
